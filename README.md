Hi there, fellow coder. 

This repo is too help me apply better algorithms to the competitive programming questions on CodeForces and help you see answers of Coding questions of the same. 

These questions are from the Problem Set section. 

The questions will be sorted according to there difficulty level. 

These answers are not the best out there but there work and they don't have any hints or comments in them for the easy difficulty section or you can say question that have their difficulty < 1600. 

You can try to understand what the code does and make changes in your own solution with a better solution and try to implement them. 

Hope you have a great time in you Coding Journey.
