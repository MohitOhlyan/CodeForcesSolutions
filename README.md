Hi there, fellow coder. 

This repo is too help you see answers of Coding questions on Codeforces. 

These questions are from the Problem Set section. 

The questions will be sorted according to there difficulty level. 

These answers are not the best out there but there work and they don't have any hints or comments in them for the easy do difficulty section or difficulty < 1600. 

You can try to understand what the code does and make changes in your own solution with a better solution and try to implement them. 

Hope you have a great time in you Coding Journey.
